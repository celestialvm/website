    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>It's a Ubuntu instance, managed by Vagrant, hosting a bunch of pre-made and bespoke Ethereum-related tools.</p>

    <h3>What's the goal?</h3>
    <p>Primarily to allow anyone to run a local Ethereum node without doing much, and have a safe environment to manage their funds.</p>

    <h3>Who's behind it?</h3>
    <p>The same guy who made <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn" target="_blank">EtherAddressLookup</a>.</p>
